\section{Hadoop Overview}

Hadoop can run in multiple set-ups, these include. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Standalone
\item Pseudo-Distributed
\item Local
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distributed}

This setup is usually found in production environments. Hadoop is designed to run on multiple servers. The size of the environment can range from two or three servers to many hundreds of servers. 

\subsection{Pseudo-Distributed}

This typically is used for local development to see if Yarn is working correctly (We will talk more about Yarn later). This mode simulates a distributed environment by using multiple processes on a users computer. It takes a bit of configuration but once setup your simulated servers will talk to each other over SSH on localhost. 

\subsection{Standalone}

Standalone is usually used to get a hello-world example working. This has the disadvantage that whatever jobs you submit to it are not running on a distributed environment. Most of the time it is recommended to use Pseudo-Distributed when working locally
